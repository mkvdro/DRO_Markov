# DRO-Markov

This readme file explains how to reproduce the plots presented in the paper "Distributionally Robust Optimization with Markovian Data: Theory and Algorithms".


## Usage

You can directly run the main.m file in each folder for the sample size T=500. You can also modify the value of T in the pseudo_data.m and generate new settings for main.m to get more results from any sample size you prefer. 

## Dependencies

This [matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) program depends on [matlab optimization toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html) and [econometrics toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/econometrics.html).
